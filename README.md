# Super-TicTacToe
Super Tic Tac Toe is just like regular Tic Tac Toe, except the board is 9x9. This game can be played with humans, random AI players, and intelligent minimax AI players.
## How to Play
Super Tic Tac Toe is started via command line, using the tictactoe.py file. The general structure of the command line arguments is as follows:
```
./tictactoe.py {human,random,minimax} [options] {human,random,minimax} [options]
```
You can run
```
./tictactoe.py --help
```
for more info on how the command line arguments work.
## Development Information
Super Tic Tac Toe was developed on MacOS Sonoma (14.2.1) using Python version 3.9.6. The GUI was created with PyGame, argument parsing with ArgParse, and the rest was done completely by me!
